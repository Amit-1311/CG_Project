# Life In A Metro

## Overview

Welcome to the "Life In A Metro" Computer Graphics Project! This README provides an overview of the project, its goals, and the concepts it aims to illustrate using OpenGL. The project's primary objective is to showcase the use of pre-built functions in OpenGL to create visually appealing and meaningful computer graphics scenes. Computer graphics play a vital role in displaying art, images, and visual data effectively to consumers. This project simulates a metro train's journey passing over a bridge through a city, mountains, and a river, transitioning through various time periods to create a visually engaging experience.

## Project Description

The "Life In A Metro" Computer Graphics Project is designed to demonstrate the practical application of computer graphics concepts, particularly using OpenGL. Computer graphics is a technology used to effectively process and display visual data, including images and art. In this project, we leverage OpenGL to create a dynamic and visually engaging scene that represents a metro train's journey through different landscapes and time periods.

## Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Illustrate OpenGL Usage:** The project aims to showcase the use of pre-built functions and techniques in OpenGL for creating visually appealing graphics.

2. **Create a Realistic Scene:** The project simulates the journey of a metro train, passing over a bridge, through a city, mountains, and a river. The goal is to create a visually immersive and realistic experience.

3. **Time Transitions:** The project demonstrates the transition of time, starting with a sunny day when the train crosses the bridge, followed by an evening scene with a sunset, and concluding with a night view of the city and mountains.

4. **Aesthetic and Critical Issues:** The project is built to understand and address critical and aesthetic issues in computer graphics and mixed media, emphasizing the importance of visual aesthetics in rendering.

## Usage

This project can serve as a valuable learning resource for students and enthusiasts in computer graphics. It offers insights into the application of OpenGL for creating visually engaging scenes. Users can explore the project to understand how to use pre-built functions, handle time transitions, and address aesthetic and critical issues in computer graphics.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you'll need:

- A computer with OpenGL installed.
- A compatible development environment or code editor.

You can access the project source code and related files to understand how the scenes and transitions are implemented.

## Project Scenes

The "Life In A Metro" project includes the following scenes:

1. **Sunny Day**: The metro train crosses a bridge in the city with a beautiful sunny sky in the background.

2. **Evening Sunset**: As the day progresses, the scene transitions to evening with a mesmerizing sunset view.

3. **Night View**: The project concludes with a night view of the city and mountains, showcasing the city's lights and the serene mountain landscape.
